The visuals, the atmosphere, the gameplay mechanics they're all so wonderful! This game has some really dark themes from suicide to miscarriage, if you explore everything in the game you will come across all sorts of dark themes. When I mentioned gameplay mechanics I was talking about the memories you get from defeating each enemy and learning their life before they died. Gameplay itself is nothing special. It's decent enough and while i found it fun, the gameplay not being anything deep might not be everyone's cup of tea. It can also get sort of repetitive but for story reasons. Now the story, wow this story is such a rich and well written story. The story is very original, it's not generic or anything. Just when you think you've figured out the story it just pulls you back in and sends you off into another direction. It's one of my favorite videogame stories I've ever had the privilege to play through. This is why I give this game a 10. Gameplay might not be anything special but the story is fantastic that it makes up for its few flaws. I highly recommend this wonderful game! Plus there's a dog in the game you can pet, easily a 10/10.","A masterpiece in every sense of the word, beautiful graphics, a delightful piano soundtrack, and brilliant writing.\r The fact the Western branch decided to completely ignore this in exchange for promoting the dreadful Net Idol Torture Porn game called \"AI: The Somnium Files\" is proof that their marketing team is incompetent in every possible way.","\u0414\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0438\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430\r- \u0421\u044e\u0436\u0435\u0442. \u041d\u0435\u0442, \u0441\u0435\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0437\u043d\u043e.

story. Character models and levels are really detailed and colorful. Feels like you're playing an anime. All in all a fun game.","Crystar has been one of my favourite games this year. just like how Nanana puts it \"it's Fun and Exciting\"\r GAMEPLAY\rThe gameplay isn't bad, but it's not great. It feels a bit outdated, you get combos, and can make your own as well just by chain attacks. but once you do it once, its get repetitive. the only thing that changes is your Skills which are unique to each of the 4 characters. its not difficult. on Normal i may have killed off a couple of the characters twice, just to bring them back within a second using an item that is fairly cheap. Attack Chains are very generous letting you get to over 300 hits on bosses, and 100 on smaller enemies when there is a few.\r This is a JRPG, so you get to level each of the 4 characters (using one character will level the other 3, but with less XP). There is Skills as mentioned before which unlock at various levels, Sentiments that you get from Crying your soul out to pure the Torments you have gotten from mini Bosses during Ordeals (the Games quests) and Sentiments with buffs (extra HP and Immunity to enemy effects etc). Each character gets 1 Attack Sentiment, 1 Defence and 2 Extra sentiments that can change all your stats or give you extra Immunity types to enemy effects.\r CHARACTERS\rEach character is unique and has their own personality. Rei the Shut-in that just wants to save Mirai, Kokoro the House Wife type which lost her future Husband and Baby and wants revenge on Anamnesis (1 of 4 Antagonists), Sen who lost her mum in a bus Accident and lives for Justice and rules, Nanana who is a child that died in the real world and became a Revenant that later joined Rei because she treated her unlike the other Revenants (her back story is tragic, and involves rope, and sad parents)\r STORY\rthe story pulls you in as you save your sister, and the plot twists throughout keep you on your toes. most of the tragedies are reverted as you start the next playthrough to get the TRUE ending. unlike some games that require you to choose options and that chooses your fate, the options you get don't change the outcome, it just makes you feel bad for doing it.\r Once you get to the end of the first Playthrough, you go back to the beginning with a small difference to the plot, and after that intro, you fast-forward to Chapter 6 which is a nice touch because everything from now on slowly changes to get the next ending. repeat this once more and you get a new chapter to get the real true ending, which is sad and happy... just because because everything is happy in the end doesn't make the previous events less dark.\r GRAPHICS\rThe Art Style is great, and the character models are good, but the world textures are your classic Japanese game, low res and smooth, except for the nice Bloom and reflective surfaces that reflect the games sky box. with all the levels in the sky, the sky boxes look great, while the only level is has a different atmosphere with it being dark and surrounded by water which looks great with the light particles floating around. The Effects of the weapons are also some of the best i have seen in a JRPG.\r OVERALL\rIf you can overcome the games simple Gameplay and play for the story like i did, you can see yourself play this game just to see the ending. you can watch it on YouTube if you like as well (i have a full playthrough on my Channel: Katsudon96 Gaming) you get attached to characters and when something you weren't expecting to that character, you start to get sad. I was always rooting for one character, and then immediately shove the other in the dirt just because they did something i didn't like.\r Top notch game","I loved Crystar. Yes, there are some weak points in repetitiveness and also in the characters themselves, but in the end, it wasn't a game I regretted buying new, and here I sit, wanting the games I am playing from my \"next\" list to be more like Crystar.\r A few words of warning: this game is dark. It contains a very haunting scene of a child's suicide, done in childlike yet realistic and haunting sketch art,  and it references miscarriage, death, neglect, torture, and abuse. Many involving children. You fill in a Memoirs of the Dead, that tells three episodes of the tragic lives and deaths of the spirits that you are contracted to execute.\r The game is an action JRPG about a girl named Rei who is sucked into Purgatory for some unknown (at the time) reason, and while  wandering around, discovers that her odd little sister Mirai has been sucked in with her. In an odd chain of events, she develops powers and ends up stabbing Mirai. Insert the \"curators\" of Purgatory, two mischievous girls who promise that if she becomes their warrior and then executes the rebellious stray  souls, and also collects humans tears that form a substance called Idea, they will revive Mirai. The catch? She only has until Mirai wanders through too the Cogs of Renewal that will reincarnate her.\rAs Rei starts her journey, she will, of course, meet other girls on their own journeys.\r Pros:\rBackground - The background is a beautiful and mesmerizing trip through gothic, dark, majestic, and even whimsical lands.\rSoundtrack- The soundtrack supplies an expansive, and also mesmerizing classical soundtrack that uses violins to make your emotions connect to the beautiful backgrounds.\rGraphics &amp; Art - I have no complaints about the character stylings, and it creates a stark contrast to the dark, childlike, and jerky illustration scenes done in a haunting sepia.\rGameplay - Action RPG where you use both weapons and SP magic attacks. Magic attacks unlock as you gain levels. You can also collect tears to unleash a power attack, and then a super attack using your Guardian. Your Guardian is essentially your inner strength, and essentially the only moment anyone can connect this game to Persona (read that review calling it a Persona clone and laughed).\rThe Map - Why mention the map? Well, if you've ever played an old school JRPG, or even Kingdom Hearts, you know how amazing a good map can be. This one folds and expands, highlights enemies as red dots, and it even shows you where you have yet to travel.\r Cons-\rCharacters- The characters delve heavily into almost dissolving on themselves in their effort to find a crusade our a cause to believe in. Rei herself goes through a whiny and selfish phase, and I honestly almost reached my max on hearing Mirai's name. Yes, I was flinching by the middle. The second character she meets is obsessed with her cause, to the level of blindness. And the third is fixated on the only cause that allows her to function. Until it threatens to become a hard lesson in humanity and exceptions.\rRepetitiveness-This was mentioned in the beginning. To avoid spoilers, just know that the true end requires you to replay some of the same levels and the same bosses over and over...and over. You restart at the X point, and replay your fate.\r Overall, I was happy to get the the ending, but at the same time, I was sad afterwards. I'll miss Sen. I'll miss Anamnesis, and dammit I will especially miss canine sweetheart Thelema. Clocking in at about 40 hours of gameplay if you take your time, and at about 86-90 for a Platinum if you take your time, I defeated it on easy, and was left glaring at the next game I moved on to. I played for so long, that I changed the controls in Ys to match Crystar. It left a lingering impression, and it left me feeling appreciative for what the art team and the designers set out to create. It stands out from the pack as a truly unique and beautiful journey.","It's a competent ARPG. Combat is smooth, not too difficult nor too easy. The story's quite sad but it's pretty well written. Overall a good game.","Great music, nice story, and a decent gameplay, Loved the game. and it`s dark tone.","This is a dark game with good story and gameplay, nice soundtrack, repetitive.","Great art and music plus a decent story. The combat is serviceable but unfortunately it's way too easy and areas tend to drag on for too long. It's still mindless fun but too repetitive for its own good. Worth playing if you can find it on sale.","The story is the strongest part of the game and I absolutely love it but unfortunately, the same can't be said for the gameplay. I want to give it a higher rating but I'd be lying to myself because the difficulty is utterly laughable and the enemies are a complete joke and provide no challenge other than being mooks that you whack with a weapon to get stronger to whack stronger mooks and being spoiled by Kingdom Hearts 3 is also why I can't give it higher than a 7.\r If you're in it for the story, there's a really good one but if for the gameplay, play Kingdom Hearts 3 or Devil May Cry 5 instead: all are Hack and Slash Titles like this one but miles better than this one.","Awesome story and characters. Very fun. Love the art design and the music too.","Crystar \u00e9 um jogo que tem uma \u00f3tima premissa, mas vai progressivamente decaindo e o final decepciona. O sistema de combate \u00e9 mediano, a trilha sonora \u00e9 boa e a hist\u00f3ria \u00e9 interessante","Its a really bad game and dont deserve that high score anime fans are stupied","Terrible game with cringe story and characters, the gameplay is so clunky and repetitive.","No Spoilers Here\r This game is strange, that's about as informative as I can be about my experience off the bat.\r I'm not a fan of visual novel games &amp; this sort of has one which is why this needs a patch for auto text so I don't have to press X every time someone finishes a sentence, I'd just like to sit back &amp; enjoy the cutscene.\r So the game has a strange mix of Action RPG, Visual Novel, Hack &amp; Slash elements &amp; crafting &amp; does them alright it's just the combat is extremely repetitive &amp;... kinda kills the game for me despite the good writing.\r I stuck with the game for Seven/Eight hours &amp; only played with the first two playable characters the combat is different depending on character, which is good because the art-style makes the game look incredibly cheap &amp; the cutscenes are either playable models of the characters or still images of what looks like a child's drawing, I don't like it but the playable ones are okay mostly because of the voice acting, which is pretty good. With some exceptions.\r The main character Rei Hatada is the best character to use for combat she has more variety with combos &amp; magic attacks making her the most balances &amp; interesting to use.\rThe second (Because I don't want to spoil) character is a pretty great as a character in terms of story &amp; writing but she's awful in combat, slow but heavy hits make combat a chore &amp; is one of the reasons why I didn't finish the game I have would liked to but It's just not for me.\r Oh, I forgot the Soundtrack... Well, it's okay but it does it's job well in the background but let's just say I really love the song \"Room\" It's great.\r Game with great potential but held back by grind &amp; repetition, not a bad game just average.\rBut that's probably the worst part.","Infelizmente n\u00e3o \u00e9 um g\u00eanero que agrada a muita gente e acredito que poderia ser melhor trabalhado","Horible Story and charachters, the fighting system is horible too, i don't recomend that","Terrible game with cringe story and characters, the gameplay is so clunky and repetitive.\rControls are like driving a tank, the frame rates keep dropping and i had 5 crashes so far.\rVery bad game.","Game is very boring, everything is repetitive and very clunky, wouldn\u2019t recommend, the character are unlikeable","As others say, the gameplay is not that interesting but the story and the characters are very good.","Who rated this game so high??????? The second game is TW3 with 92 score and this is 96? Outrageous!","I don't like the story too much it's horrible, and too disappointing. And gameplay is bad.","No review text.","THIS IS FOR ANYONE ENTICED BY THE USER SCORE! I bought the game and it is an uninspired mess! I have played several hours and literally every battle can be won by going close to the enemy and pressing square until the enemy dies. There is absolutely zero challenge in this game. You learn all sorts of moves that basically have zero utility and you get a persona like being that also is not necessary to win any of this game's easy battles. Having played as long as I have, I have encountered about 3-4 unique enemies. In essence, I have spent like 6-7 hours fighting the same 3-4 enemies ad nauseum. You get new characters but they play almost exactly like the main character does in the context of the game itself. All you do is run and attack things with any of the characters. THAT'S IT! Do not be fooled by the fact that it has a great user score. I am not sure what these people were thinking but some are suggesting the combat is not too easy. It is the easiest combat I have come across since every single battle can be won by running from enemy to enemy and pressing square until you win. This is made especially easy since there are about 3-4 enemy types and you quickly learn their patterns. Not that you need to because they do basically no damage to you. I have yet to use an item, I have yet to die, I have yet to feel challenged in any way, I have yet to buy anything from the in game merchant, I have not grinded at all and I can go through every level with zero threat. Not good, if we are being honest.","Let me just say that yes, the game has some flaws (mostly when it comes to gameplay), but despite those flaws I enjoyed my playthrough so much that I'm giving it a 10/10 regardless. I'll instead rate each individual element of the game below to give an idea of what to expect going in.\r Music: 10/10\rAn absolute gem of a soundtrack. Severally limited by the game due to some weird sound mixing and prioritization. Some sound testing with the volume settings might be needed to find a good balance between music, voice and sound effects. The OST is full of leitmotifs, variety and outer-worldly tunes. There's some rock tracks that go HARD, some real tearjerkers, surprise jazz and plenty of violin/piano goodness.\r Graphics: 8/10.\rLooks pretty enough and there's nothing wrong about it. Some attack animations and effects are really flashy and enjoyable. But the visual thing that'll really catch your attention is...\r Art and Art Direction: 10/10\rIt's gorgeous. The game's cutscenes feature a visual novel-esque formate with character art for each character with dialogue. It's incredibly pretty, detailed and it isn't afraid to change even the most minute facial details to reflect the characters current mood. There are also these really artistc drawing-esque cutscenes for memory segments that are quite striking. There's also this really nice Studio Trigger intro animation that plays whenever you start the game.\r Voice Acting: 10/10\rI'm blown away. I played the game with English voice-acting because someone recommended it and I'm very pleasantly surprised on how good it was. Even some of the minor background voices are really well acted. The main cast absolutely nailed their roles and even weaved in their personalities whenever exposition was dumped (props for the writer for not making exposition be dragged out and boring).\r Story: 9/10\rI thoroughly enjoyed the story and all it's twists. I found myself making theories about how things were going to play out and got dumbfounded when some revelations were revealed. The best thing is that the game foreshadows a lot, but it's practically impossible to understand any of it without context. It's a very cohesive and thought out narrative, with some very emotional moments to boot. The AAA-game market really need to step-up their stories. There has been so many AA and indie games that completely overshadow the AAA-games story-wise recently. All that budget and most big studios can't even write a compelling story...\r Gameplay: 6.5/10.\rOkay this is the least good aspect of the game. It isn't bad, the core gameplay is very fun and fluid once you get a hang for it. But the enemy variety and level design is lacking severely.\r Enemy Variety: There are like 10 or so enemies in the game (not counting bosses) which you'll fight over and over again. They sometimes gain a new move, but it gets stale. Some skill unlocks and enemy density helps the game feel fresh throughout a playthrough, but it still gets a bit monotonous at times.\r Level Design: The environments you go through are very pretty, but the areas you directly move your character around in usually only consist of rectangular flat rooms. Sometimes there are a bit more complex rooms with cover and some slopes/stairs to add a bit of verticality. The game could've used the addition of traps/boons, some more tailor-made set pieces and generally more intuitive level design depending on where the areas were set. For example: there was this stage where you story-wise ascended a tower, but that wasn't reflected in the level design, which was a huge missed opportunity. The placements for items and treasure chests are also very predictable and not so exciting. Only very late in the game did the game surprise me with the occasional bundle of treasure/item nodes.\r The gameplay will be more enjoyable for some than others, The fluidity and earn-able skills make the gameplay addictive, which can help some people stomach the lack of enemy and level variety. Although it seems like one of the gameplay designers really hated 1 of the 4 playable characters specifically, since her gameplay is absolute hot rubbish compared to the other 3 characters.\r Conclusion:\rIf your looking for a incredibly rewarding visual and auditory experience then I highly recommend this game. The gameplay, despite it's flaws, is really fun in moderations. It really just lacks in enemy/level variety, which might be because of budget/time constraints.","Strange. The user score has 2000 positive but no reviews. And I found the first 10 reviewers Only review this game with 10.","The gameplay is a bit boring, but the story and the characters in this game are so good! The soundtrack by Sakuzyo is also great.","This type of game isn't going to be for everyone - as JRPGs go it also is a bit unique. I loved the characters each one felt unique and had their own personality and quirks. The art style can be a bit overbearing at times and you do end up with an overall feeling that the game play is repetitive.\rThe story does deliver several gut punches at several points in the game and as the story progresses you get a good idea where the plot is going, but feel compelled to find out how it gets there and what the next thing to unfold will be.\r The game is split in to chapters each having a certain number of stages and you return to your room as the hub world where you can perform tasks to purify your heart and level up equipment.\r Spoilers ahead:\rOnce you complete the game on the first pass you do get an epilogue which sends you back in to a sort of new game + mode but with a different story and twist it would seem at first glance. The more times you complete the game the more story unlocks and the more puzzle pieces fit together. After all it is purgatory.\rThe nit pick I have here is that the maps don't change on the next part of the story. Also to complete the bestiary you have to kill 3 of each kind of spirit - and 3 of the more powerful types (I forget what they are called) and with the same monster type appearing over and over it can be frustrating to find the ones you are missing.\r Gameplay   : 8\rPlot    : 9\rCharacters : 9 (love Nanana )\rSoundtrack :  9\rOverall    : 9","Anime fans literally have no sense of taste.
